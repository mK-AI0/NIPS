In order to run the notebook - you will probably need access to a GPU machine with 64GB of RAM. If you message Saturn Cloud (look for chat in the lower right window) and say "I'm competing in NeurIPS 2023", your account will be upgraded to allow access to more powerful instance types. Once you've been upgraded, you should be able to modify the instance tier to a machine with more RAM.
